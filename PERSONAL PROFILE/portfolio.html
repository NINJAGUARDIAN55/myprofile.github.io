                    <p>I enjoy working on websites and I have done a few projects in a couple of my classes. 
                        These are two that I really enjoyed and spent a lot of time on in my class at the Catalyst
                        Center. I have done many more of my own projects including one for a book that I am writing
                        called <em>"The World of Shards" &copy;</em>

                    <h2>-------- Photography --------</h2>
                    <p>Taking pictures is something I enjoy and spend a lot of time doing. Some of my favorite pictures 
                        are of nature and many things that I find memorable. Photography is a great way for me to record 
                        and show part of myself. It also allows for showing different perspectives and vision of how things 
                        might be.

                    <h2>-------- Culinary Arts --------</h2>
                    <p>Cooking is another hobby that I enjoy, some specific favorites being baking anything from cakes, muffins, and breads. 
                        Another is grilling and seasoning meats with certain dishes as taste and texture and incredible. One of my top 
                        favorite things to cook is pizza which I have spent a lot of time changing and evolving the recipe to my liking and 
                        many others as well. Overall, I work to learn how to cook some new things and really enjoy perfecting the taste of 
                        the recipes I make.
