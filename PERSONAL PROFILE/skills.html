                <dd>Strong Work Ethic</dd>
                <dt>I maintain a strong work ethic in the jobs and tasks I do by
                    focussing on the quality of work, and the precision by which I
                    complete the task. I personally feel that the quality of task takes
                    higher priority than time of completion.

                <dd>Problem Solving</dd>
                <dt>I enjoy problem solving and working through complex tasks.
                    Overcoming obstacles in projects or any work evironment is 
                    something I have learned throughout my highschool experience, 
                    especially as I have been transitioning to college.

                <dd>Communication</dd>
                <dt>Expressing important updates and work related issues to those I work
                    with is something I find of critical importance. I work to communicate 
                    with my coworkers and improve relations with those in my work area.
                    With this communication, I help to improve the efficency the job and overall
                    work envirionment

                <dd>Creativity</dd>
                <dt>I am creative in my work and my job so I can find the most efficency and 
                    flexibility. Being creative allows me to work around a problem and look at
                    it from a different angle. Creativity allows me also to make the most out of 
                    the work I do and receive the most satisfaction.

                <dd>Conflict Resolution</dd>
                <dt>Working hard to resolve conflict is one thing I try to do. Whether it is 
                    between myself or other people, I try to find a peaceful solution through
                    moderation. Helping to find a compromise or best path forward is important 
                    for those I work with and for the work place.
